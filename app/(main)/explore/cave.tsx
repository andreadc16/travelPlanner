                    Enchanted Cave is a natural limestone cave located in Bolinao, Pangasinan, Philippines. It features a crystal-clear natural spring pool inside, surrounded by coral walls and rock formations, indicating that the area was once submerged underwater. The cave is part of a private resort that
                    offers visitors a chance to swim in the cool, fresh waters and explore the surrounding gardens and exhibits.
