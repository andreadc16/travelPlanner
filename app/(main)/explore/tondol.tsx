                    Tondol Beach, located in Anda, Pangasinan, is a serene coastal destination renowned for its expansive white sand and crystal-clear, shallow waters. The beach's gentle slope allows visitors to wade hundreds of meters into the sea, making it ideal for families and those seeking a tranquil beach experience. During low tide, a sandbar emerges, connecting the mainland to nearby Tanduyong Island, which can be reached on foot. The beach is
                    also a gateway to other attractions, such as the Panacalan Sandbar and the Hundred Islands National Park.  </Text>
